      <h2>What Does “Changing a Credit Card” Actually Mean?</h2>
      <p>“Changing” a card can refer to several different actions: asking for a product change within the same issuer, upgrading to a more premium card, downgrading to a lower-fee card or closing an account entirely. Each path has different implications for fees, benefits and account history.</p>
      <p>Issuers often use their own terminology, but the core question is the same: will your existing account continue with new terms, or will a brand-new account be opened and the old one closed? Understanding that distinction is key to predicting how a change might affect your credit file and rewards.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Product Changes vs New Applications</h2>
      <p>With a product change, your existing account number typically stays the same while the underlying card product changes. This can preserve your account age and history while adjusting annual fees, benefits or earn structure. Issuers may restrict which products you can move between and how often changes are allowed.</p>
      <p>Opening a new card, on the other hand, usually involves a fresh credit check and a new account line. The old card may remain open or be closed later at your request. New applications can unlock welcome bonuses, but they also add to the number of hard inquiries and active accounts on your file.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How Card Changes Affect Rewards and Benefits</h2>
      <p>When you upgrade or downgrade, your earn rates, bonus categories and benefits may change immediately or at the start of a new statement cycle. Some programs allow you to keep existing points under the same umbrella, while others may convert, restrict or even forfeit certain rewards on change.</p>
      <p>Benefits like lounge access, insurance coverage and statement credits are tied to the product you hold at a given time. After a change, you may lose some benefits and gain others, so it is important to understand the new package before confirming the switch.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Closing Cards, Annual Fees and Retention Offers</h2>
      <p>Closing a card can simplify your wallet and reduce annual fees, but it may also reduce your total available credit and remove an aged account from your profile after some time. Both effects can influence how your credit score responds in the medium term.</p>
      <p>Before closing, issuers sometimes offer retention incentives such as statement credits, reduced fees or bonus points in exchange for keeping the card. Evaluating these offers against your actual usage helps you decide whether to accept, downgrade or proceed with cancellation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Practical Steps Before You Request a Change</h2>
      <p>Before making a change, it can be helpful to redeem vulnerable rewards, move points to more stable ecosystems if allowed, and review any pending statements or refunds. Verifying recurring payments and subscriptions linked to the card reduces the risk of missed charges during the transition.</p>
      <p>It is also worth checking how the change might affect promotional rates, balance transfer terms or installment plans. In some cases, product changes may end intro offers or alter fees in ways that only show up on future statements.</p>
