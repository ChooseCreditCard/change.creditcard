  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What Does “Changing Your Credit Card” Actually Mean?</h2>
    <p>
      A credit card “change” covers several different situations depending on what the issuer does. The most common types are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Upgrade</strong> – moving to a higher-tier card with more perks or higher annual fee.</li>
      <li><strong>Downgrade</strong> – moving to a simpler card with a lower fee.</li>
      <li><strong>Product change</strong> – switching to a different card within the same issuer without a new application.</li>
      <li><strong>Reissue</strong> – receiving a new card due to expiration or fraud alerts.</li>
      <li><strong>Replacement</strong> – receiving a new card if the old one is lost, stolen or damaged.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each type has different effects on your rewards balance, account age, card number and fees.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Product Change -->
  <section id="product-change" class="section">
    <h2>Product Changes: When You Switch Cards Without Reapplying</h2>
    <p>
      A product change lets you switch cards within the same bank without submitting a new application or triggering a new
      hard credit pull. This can be useful if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your current card’s annual fee is no longer worth it.</li>
      <li>You want better reward categories without opening a new account.</li>
      <li>The bank has discontinued your old card product.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Typically:
      <br>– Your existing credit line stays the same.
      <br>– Your account age does not reset.
      <br>– Rewards usually transfer over, but terms vary by issuer.
      <br>– A new physical card is issued, sometimes with a new number.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Replacement / Number Change -->
  <section id="replacement" class="section">
    <h2>Replacements: Lost, Stolen or Expired Cards</h2>
    <p>
      Replacements happen when your physical card needs to be reissued due to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss or theft</li>
      <li>Card damage</li>
      <li>Fraud alerts or suspected compromise</li>
      <li>Expired card date</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In most cases:
      <br>– Your account remains the same.
      <br>– Rewards and statements are unaffected.
      <br>– A new card number may or may not be issued depending on situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digital wallets update the card automatically with many banks, but not all — check your banking app.

    <h2>When a Card Change Makes Sense</h2>
    <p>Changing your card may be a good idea when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your spending patterns have shifted (e.g., more travel, less dining).</li>
      <li>You want to lower fees without closing the account.</li>
      <li>Your current perks no longer fit your lifestyle.</li>
      <li>You want to keep account age for credit score purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Avoid unnecessary changes that reset bonuses or reduce earn rates unless the long-term savings outweigh the short-term losses.
